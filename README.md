## ✨ Features

The system provides two main generative AI-powered capabilities:

### 1. Patient Cohort Generator 

Clinical cohort definition is crucial for patient recruitment in clinical trials and cohort identification in observational studies. The Cohort Generator automates the translation of complex inclusion/exclusion criteria into accurate SQL queries through the following pipeline:

![Cohort Generator Workflow](docs/examples/assets/cohort_generator_workflow.png)

**🔄 Processing Pipeline:**
1. **📝 Criteria Parsing**: Converts raw input cohort criteria into semi-structured definitions
2. **🔍 RAG-Enhanced Processing**: Utilizes two-level Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with:
   - Criteria-specific knowledge base (EpiAskKB)
   - Cohort-level knowledge base (EpiCohortKB)
3. **⚡ Query Generation**: Creates RAG-enhanced instruction prompts for SQL query generation
4. **🏷️ Medical Concept Mapping**: Maps medical concepts to standardized medical coding systems
5. **🗄️ SQL Generation**: Produces verified executable SQL queries for final cohort identification
6. **📊 Patient Funnel**: Generates detailed tracking of inclusion/exclusion steps

**📈 Results:**

For more information, please refer to our [manuscript](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.21107).

### 2. Question Answering System 

Enables natural language querying of clinical data by automatically translating questions into SQL queries and generating human-readable answers, based on our previous NAACL Clinical NLP Workshop paper.

This is a re-implementation of our previous [work](https://aclanthology.org/2024.clinicalnlp-1.4/).

![Question Answering Workflow](docs/examples/assets/qa_workflow.png)

**🚀 Key Features:**
- 🗣️ Natural language question processing
- 🔍 RAG-enhanced SQL generation using question-SQL pair knowledge base (EpiAskKB)
- 🏷️ Medical concept mapping to standardized codes
- 💬 Contextual answer generation

## 📊 Knowledge Bases

The system utilizes one SQLite database (`.db` files) containing two specialized knowledge bases:

- **🗃️ EpiAskKB**: Question-SQL pairs for epidemiological question answering
- **🗃️ EpiCohortKB**: Cohort descriptions and corresponding SQL pairs for cohort generation

These knowledge bases enable the RAG-enhanced generation process described in our work.

### Query library versions

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `querylib_20251019.db` | **Current version (recommended).** Fixes runnable SQL that was truncated in the original release ([#1](https://github.com/Bayer-Group/epi-cohort-text2sql-ecai2025/issues/1)). |
| `querylib_20250825.db` | Original version used for the experiments in the paper. |

Changes in `querylib_20251019.db`:

- **No truncated SQL.** In the original file, 91 values of `QUERY_SNOWFLAKE_RUNNABLE` were cut off at 32,767 characters because of their long medical code lists. All 108 cohort queries (`COHORT_GENERATOR`) now have complete runnable SQL, with code lists regenerated as OMOP Standard concept IDs. They were checked by running them on OMOP databases (SynPUF and Optum). The code lists differ from the original, which included codes that matched no records or were off-topic.
- **Fixed queries.** Cohort queries 110, 116, 126, 162 and 186, which failed or returned no patients, were fixed. QA queries 68 and 105, whose runnable SQL still contained placeholders, were filled in.
- **Changed templates.** `QUERY_SNOWFLAKE_WITH_PLACEHOLDERS` changed for queries 110, 116, 126 and 162. Benchmark results on these queries may differ slightly from those reported in the paper. All other templates, questions and embeddings are unchanged.

Note: the evaluation in the paper used only the templated queries (`QUERY_SNOWFLAKE_WITH_PLACEHOLDERS`). Medical codes were resolved and filled in at query time, so the truncated `QUERY_SNOWFLAKE_RUNNABLE` column did not affect the reported results.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python ≥3.12
- SQLite 3.50.2 or higher 
- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) (recommended) or venv

### Option 1: Conda (Recommended)

Clone and set up the environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bayer-Group/epi-cohort-text2sql-ecai2025.git
cd epi-cohort-text2sql-ecai2025
conda create -n ascent-ai python=3.12
conda activate ascent-ai
pip install .
```

### Option 2: Virtual Environment

If you don't want to use conda, you can create a virtual environment using `venv`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bayer-Group/epi-cohort-text2sql-ecai2025.git
cd epi-cohort-text2sql-ecai2025
python3 -m venv ascent-env
source ascent-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `ascent-env\Scripts\activate`
pip install .
```

### Option 3: Direct Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Bayer-Group/epi-cohort-text2sql-ecai2025.git
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The system requires configuration for:
- AI model endpoints (Claude via AWS Bedrock, GPT via Azure, etc.)
- [Optional] Database connections (if queries are executed)

See `example.env` for configuration template.
